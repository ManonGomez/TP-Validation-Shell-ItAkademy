----Statement of the subject----
You need to create a Bash script that will allow you to set up a complete installation of Vagrant and Virtualbox on a Linux workstation. Before starting the installation of these packages, you will need to check, via a command line, if these are already installed and in which case, display a message to the user that these programs are already installed.

Your script will then be able to create a Vagrantfile automatically with the client inputs (asking questions, with for example a "read"):
- by asking to modify the name of the two folders synchronized (local [../data] and distant [/ vagrant_data])
- by asking to select from 3 boxes
- by being able to modify the IP address of the part "private_network".

Once set up, you will need to be able to view all the Vagrant currently in use on the system and be able to interact with it, such as turning off a particular machine.

Once everything is operational, you will ask him if he wants to start his vagrant.

Particular importance should be brought to the test and displays errors and ergonomics of the software. Of course, the operation of the script will count for the biggest part.

Small bonus: You will ask the user if he wants to install apache2, MySQL and PHP7.0 on his environment when the machine will be connected in SSH. If it answers "yes", you will start installing these 3 packages. A big bonus will be provided if you manage to install MySQL with 0000 as the default password, without the user having to act.

----What is it used for ?----
You will be able to simply and quickly install Vagrant and Virtualbox in a few clicks!

----Explanationss----
You do not have to be an expert to install Vagrant and Virtualbox on a Linux computer, you just have to save this file, open it with a "bash filenameName.sh" and follow the instructions.
You can remom the file, the IP and many other things! Everything becomes a thousand times simpler

Good installation, if you need precision do not hesitate to contact me
